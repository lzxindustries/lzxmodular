Electrical
============================

LZX Modular proposes an electrical interface specification for wide bandwidth analog computing instruments. It is optimized for, but not limited to: (1) generating and processing analog RGB video graphics in SD/HD resolutions, (2) affordable devices which are accessible to working artists and not just big studios, and (3) maximum patchability via a universal DC voltage range and high impedance connections.


:Bipolar Voltage Range: - A bipolar DC voltage of +/-1V corresponds to +/-100% of a parameterâ€™s range.
- A unipolar DC voltage of 0 to +1V corresponds to 0% to 100% of a parameter's range.
