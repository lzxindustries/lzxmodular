Test & Calibration
==========================================

Many users like to perform regular service and checkups on their analog hardware systems.  For many, the ability to verify a module is operating properly is useful for troubleshooting a complex system.  For others, using electronic test equipment like oscilloscopes, multimeters and firmware programmers is part of their relationship to the instrument.  With this in mind, we present models for both basic functional testing and advanced testing and calibration.  We would love to see LZX Modular equipment in use several centuries from now, due to the diligence and care taken by its community of users.

Basic Testing
---------------------------------

- Power supply capable of 1 amps or more of current at 12 volts DC (EuroRack, Generic Wall Wart Adapter, etc)
- A video display with Composite or Component video input
- At least three RCA-to-RCA 75 ohms video cables or RCA-to-BNC 75 ohms video cables (use the native connector type present on your display) less than or equal to 2 meters in length
- At least three 3.5mm patch cables less than or equal to 1 meter in length
- EuroRack module mounting rails, either inside a EuroRack case or a bare rack frame
- ESG3 Encoder & Sync Generator module

Advanced Testing & User Calibration
--------------------------------------------------

- All items in the Basic Testing Requirements list
- A second set of all items in the Basic Testing Requirements list if the test requires it
- A dual channel oscilloscope with at least 100 MHz bandwidth and two low voltage signal probes
- A multimeter with voltmeter and ammeter functions
- Metric and imperial small nut driver and screwdriver sets for module disassembly, reassembly, and trimmer adjustment

Firmware Programming (ESG3 & DSG3)
--------------------------------------------------

- Lattice HW-USBN-2B Programming Cable
- TagConnect TC-LATTICE-10 Programming Cable Adapter
- TagConnect TC2050-IDC-NL 10-Pin No-Legs Cable with Ribbon Connector
