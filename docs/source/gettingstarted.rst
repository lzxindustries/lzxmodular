Getting Started
============================

Module Installation
----------------------

12V DC & EuroRack Power In
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Your power supply must be connected to either the 12V DC input jack or the EuroRack power connector. Do not use both connectors at the same time.

Video Sync In & Sync Out
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For each module with a Video Sync In on the rear, it must be connected to your ESG3 Encoder & Sync Generator module.  This connection may be made directly, or through a chain of other modules.  ESG3 Encoder & Sync Generator may be connected to other ESG3 Encoder & Sync Generator modules in this manner, or it's Video Sync In may be left disconnected.
